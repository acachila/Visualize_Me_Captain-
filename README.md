Introduction:

Historically, studies have found a relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. The impact of this relationship is however different. The empirical result of the cross-sectional study implies there is in fact a relationship between per capita GDP and per capita carbon dioxide emissions. The correlation is positive, which suggests growing per capita GDP leads to increasing carbon dioxide emissions. This study aims to assess the current status of CO2 emissions and current GDP around the world.

Methods:
Using the World bank dataset on GDP and carbon emissions, we hope to create our own database through Postgres. Subsequently afterwards, we will query our database pull the dataset into python to process the raw data.  Here, we will groupby each countries and prepare the set to create a d3 dashboard (javascript) to display our aggregate data and hope to answer our question.
